# lein-sass 

Leiningen plugin to compile SASS/SCSS files with [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/)

> If you are looking for compatibility with [SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc) or
older versions of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), look at the pre 1.0 versions.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lein-sass/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lein-sass)


## Installation

You can install the plugin by adding lein-sass to your `project.clj` file in the `plugins` section:

```clj
(defproject example "1.0.0"
  :plugins [[lein-sass "0.4.0"]])
```

You will also need to install `sass`. Please see https://sass-lang.com/install/ for full installation instructions. 

## Configuration

Here is an example of `project.clj` with all the possible definitions.

You must provide a `:targets` configuration, which only supports the [Many-to-Many Mode](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#many-to-many-mode). All other options are optional.

```clj
(defproject example-project "1.2.3"
  :sass {:targets ["resources/sass:resources/public/css"]
         ;; other options (provided are default values):
         ;; :source-maps false
         ;; :style :compressed
         }
```


## Usage

To compile your files once:

```sh
$ lein sass once
```

To keep the compiler running and watch for changes:

```sh
$ lein sass watch
```

To delete all the files generated by lein-sass

```
$ lein sass clean
```


## Hooks

The following hooks are supported by lein-sass:

```
$ lein compile
$ lein clean
```

To enable the hooks, add the following to your `project.clj` file:

```clj
:hooks [leiningen.sass]
```
